title: Qodly Models

The structure of your project is called a Model. When you click on an empty space in the Data Model Editor, you can view the properties for your Model(coming soon). By default, a Model does not contain any default datastore classes; you can create datastore classes from the Data Model Editor.

You access your current project's model by double-clicking on  ![alt-text](img/model-icon.png) in your project's sidebar menu.

***Note**: You can zoom out on your project's model to view the whole structure of the datastore classes it contains; or zoom in to get a clearer view of a specific datastore class.*

### Model editor interface

In Qodly, the structure of your Model is organized in a new way that allows you to better manage your datastore classes, attributes, functions and their properties.

You will find more in depth information in Model Editor - overview on everything interface **from the toolbar to the Properties Area**

### Datastore Classes

A Datastore is an interface that allows us to reference a structure and access its data; Datastore Classes are object models within it that describe this data. Tables in the database provided by the datastore are handled through Datastore Classes. A dataclass is related to a single Datastore in which you can add custom functions. Each field of the table is an attribute of the dataclass.

### Attributes

An attribute is the smallest storage cell in our relational database, Itâ€™s used to designate dataclass properties that store data.

Relation attributes are used to conceptualize relations between dataclasses (many-to-one and one-to-many).

### Datastore functions 

Datastore functions allow us to execute code that can be applied to the Datastore Class in order to process data, manipulate data and create result sets.
